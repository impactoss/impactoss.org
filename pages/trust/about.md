## Vision

A world in which technology plays a critical role in the effective implementation of human rights and sustainable development, as well as sharing of knowledge, empowering vulnerable groups and creating greater accountability and transparency.

## Objectives

Our objectives are to advance the enjoyment of human rights and the realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by developing, maintaining, promoting and training in the use of suitable open source technologies that will

* improve States' and Civil Society's ability to implement, monitor, analyse and communicate States' human rights obligations and measures, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations;
* encourage transparency and accountability of States' human rights obligations and realisation of Sustainable Development Goals;
* encourage sharing of intellectual property and technological knowledge and expertise between States and Civil Society.
